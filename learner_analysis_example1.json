Use supportive feedback and clear progress indicators. Celebrate improvements while maintaining momentum. Focus on reviewing and reinforcing previous topics that need attention: loops, conditionals, data structures.\n\nDELIVERY STRATEGY: Provide 2–3 min videos per topic with transcripts.\n\n🚨 CRITICAL ATTENTION REQUIRED: The following topics appear in BOTH flagged and redo lists, requiring immediate focused intervention:\n   • loops (PRIORITY: Extra reinforcement needed)\n\n⚠️ FLAGGED TOPICS requiring special attention:\n   • variables\n   • functions\n\n🔄 REDO TOPICS needing revisitation:\n   • conditionals\n   • data structures\n\nIMPORTANT: Focus on reinforcing and clarifying concepts from 'Python object-oriented programming'. Address gaps in understanding and build stronger foundations before moving forward. Pay special attention to the flagged and redo topics listed above.\n\nFINAL INSTRUCTION: Create personalized learning content by combining the learner profile guidance with the delivery strategy, keeping the topic context in mind.",
